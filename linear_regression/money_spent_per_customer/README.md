# Money Spent Predictor
A simple Linear Regression project that predicts a customer’s Yearly Amount Spent on an e-commerce platform based on usage behavior.

## Project Overview
### We use an E-commerce customer dataset and train a regression model to predict Yearly Amount Spent using the following numerical features:
- Avg. Session Length
- Time on App
- Time on Website
- Length of Membership

### The project walks through the entire machine learning workflow:
- Data loading
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Train–test split
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Error analysis

## Model
- Linear Regression (scikit-learn)

## Evaluation
- MAE
- MSE
- RMSE

## Requirements
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## Run
jupyter notebook money_spent_predictor.ipynb
